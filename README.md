# Carrot-Fantasy  

This is my second coding project in the second-semester Python class at CMU.  

**Carrot Fantasy** is a tower defense game independently designed and developed in Python. The objective is to protect a carrot from waves of monsters by strategically building towers along a map. Players earn money by defeating monsters, which can then be used to buy, place, or sell towers. The game progresses through multiple rounds of increasing difficulty, ending with a final boss monster. The player wins if the carrot survives until the end.  

This project was fully self-designed, including the rules, interfaces, characters, and chapters. I developed the properties for the carrot, monsters, and towers, and enabled monsters to appear periodically and move dynamically along the map by modifying routes, adjusting coordinates, and optimizing time intervals. Towers can be built anywhere on the map and are programmed to automatically chase and attack monsters. Carrots also display different appearances when attacked, adding more visual feedback to the game.  

Additional features include interactive controls such as **pause**, **start**, and **restart** buttons, as well as a detailed **game-over page** with rich visuals. Together, these elements create a complete and engaging tower defense experience.
